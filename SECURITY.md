# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

This document outlines the security practices for the Web-Based CRM System and provides guidelines for reporting security vulnerabilities.

## üö® Critical Security Notice

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This repository previously contained hardcoded sensitive information that has been removed. If you forked or downloaded the repository before the security fixes, please:

1. **Immediately change any exposed passwords**
2. **Generate new secret keys**
3. **Update your local environment configuration**

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Practices

### Environment Variables

**NEVER commit sensitive information to version control:**

- ‚ùå Database passwords
- ‚ùå Secret keys
- ‚ùå API keys
- ‚ùå Email credentials
- ‚ùå Third-party service tokens

**‚úÖ Always use environment variables:**

```bash
# Create .env file in backend/ directory
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here-min-50-chars
DB_PASSWORD=your-database-password
```

### Required Environment Variables

The following environment variables **MUST** be set:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Django secret key (min 50 chars) | `your-super-secret-key-here...` |
| `DB_PASSWORD` | PostgreSQL password | `your-secure-password` |
| `DEBUG` | Debug mode (False in production) | `False` |

### Password Security

- **Minimum 8 characters**
- **Must contain**: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- **Password expiration**: 90 days
- **Force password change** on first login

### Authentication Security

- **JWT tokens** with 15-minute expiration
- **Refresh token rotation** enabled
- **Token blacklisting** after logout
- **Session timeout** after 15 minutes of inactivity

### Database Security

- **PostgreSQL** with proper user permissions
- **No raw SQL queries** (use Django ORM)
- **Input validation** for all user inputs
- **SQL injection protection** via parameterized queries

### API Security

- **CORS** properly configured
- **CSRF protection** enabled
- **Rate limiting** implemented
- **Input validation** on all endpoints
- **Authentication required** for protected endpoints

## üîç Security Checklist for Deployment

### Before Production Deployment:

- [ ] Set `DEBUG=False`
- [ ] Generate strong `SECRET_KEY` (50+ characters)
- [ ] Use secure database password
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True`)
- [ ] Set secure cookies (`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True`)
- [ ] Configure HSTS headers
- [ ] Set up proper CORS origins
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Configure secure file permissions
- [ ] Set up regular database backups
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting

### Environment Configuration:

```env
# Production settings
DEBUG=False
SECRET_KEY=your-production-secret-key-here
SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True
SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS=31536000
SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS=True
SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD=True
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=True
CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE=True
```
